The statement is false. The counterexample where the men 
M prefers W over W', and M' prefers W' over W,
The women W prefers M' over M, and W' prefers m over M',
creates a stable matching where both parts in the pair 
does not have their partner as the first preference.

# 2

The statement is true. Following the stable matching algorithm,
M starts proposing to its highest preference M.
Since W has M ranked first, it will match with M if it is 
already unmatched, and switch to M if it is already matched.

# 5

a)

Modifying the Gale-Shapley algorithm such that 
the person that asks first is preferred in an indifference,
guarantees that a perfect matching is found with no strong 
instability. 

b) 

In the case where every man has the same preferences, and 
every women is indifferent, a perfect matching with a weak 
instability can be made.


# 8

With the following preference lists:

m:   w,w'',w'
m':  w,w',w''
m'': w',w,w''

w:   m'',m',m 
w':  m',m'',m
w'': any order works, as it only gets picked by m


If w uses its true preference list, w ends up paired with m'.
In the case where w swaps m and m', she ends up with m'',
which is rank one on w's list.
